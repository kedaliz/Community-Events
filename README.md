## 🚀 Overview
This is a MERN-stack application designed to connect communities through event sharing. Beyond the technical implementation, this project explores the **ethical considerations of digital community spaces**, focusing on user privacy, accessibility, and data governance.

## ⚖️ The Ethics & Policy Lens
As a student of **Ethics, Law, and Policy**, I approached this build with several key questions:
* **Data Privacy:** How is user data stored, and what are the legal implications of community-generated content?
* **Inclusion:** Is the interface accessible to diverse user groups, including those from underrepresented backgrounds?
* **Digital Governance:** How can we build community platforms that promote safety without over-reaching surveillance?

## 🎨 UX/UI Focus
Guided by my concentration in **User Experience**, this project prioritizes:
* **Information Architecture:** Ensuring a clear hierarchy of events so users can find what they need in seconds.
* **Cultural Context:** Incorporating design elements that respect diverse community identities, influenced by my minor in **Caribbean Studies**.
* **Simplicity:** A clean, minimal interface that reduces cognitive load.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Component-based UI)
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express (RESTful API)
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL cloud storage)
* **Security:** Environment variables for protected credentials.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/client`: React frontend and styling.
* `/server`: Node/Express backend logic and database models.
